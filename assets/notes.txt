#How to Diagnose Overfitting and Underfitting of LSTM Models
https://machinelearningmastery.com/diagnose-overfitting-underfitting-lstm-models/


BUGS:
- Download file - set symbol to uppercase always
- Create folders when training, downloading, etc... (Folders: analysis, models, data, etc...)

Fix overfitting:
The validation loss is increasing while the training loss is decreasing.

Dealing with such a Model:
- Data Preprocessing: Standardizing and Normalizing the data.
- Model compelxity: Check if the model is too complex. Add dropout, reduce number of layers or number of neurons in each layer.
- Learning Rate and Decay Rate: Reduce the learning rate, a good starting value is usually between 0.0005 to 0.001. Also consider a decay rate of 1e-6.
